# About

Share encrypted text and URLs. Or don't encrypt URLs, if you wish, they're just links anyways.

Wait... its free?! I'm the customer! You must be stealing my data, right?

You would be, but I run this primarily for myself, friends, and family.
I'm happy to share it with others for free, at least while it doesn't cost me much.

It's also [open-source](https://github.com/jamesford/lock.sh) so you can audit the code and/or self-host your own instance.

That said, if I haven't already, I might connect a self-hosted [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) instance to see if anyone is actually using this.

import Layout from '../components/Layout'
import Back from '../components/Back'

export default ({ children }) => (

    <Back />
    <div className="mx-5 max-w-prose p-1 prose">{children}</div>
  </Layout>
)
